# Predicting-Grades-through-DataMining-Techniques
This Project proposes the application of data mining techniques to predict the grades of students, based on their historical data. In this project, I have used two well- known data mining techniques (decision tree and random forest) on an educational dataset related to the grades given with this project.



## Description
The ability to predict the performance tendency of students is very important to improve their
skills. It has become valuable knowledge that can be used for different purposes; for example, a
strategic plan can be applied for the development of quality or keeping the track of their
performance. This Project proposes the application of data mining techniques to predict the
grades of students, based on their historical data. In this project, you are going to use two well-
known data mining techniques (decision tree and random forest) on an educational dataset
related to your grades given with this project.

# Rules to keep in mind to solve this problem
1. Preprocessing of the dataset
2. Feature selection
3. Training Model (Generate the forest of trees)
4. Testing (Prediction Phase)
5. Traversals to display the trees
6. Display the predictions of trees with mode

## 1. Preprocessing of the dataset
In the given dataset with the name of “Student’s Dataset.xlsx”, the records of 1780
undergraduate students in BS’s program were collected from the FAST school computing
NUCES. These records include Sr. No and 2 semester’s courses with data structures taken during
their bachelors’ study with their grades. 



### 1.1. Instructions for preprocessing
You are required to read the “Student’s Dataset.xlsx” file using Java and restructure this dataset
by arranging each student’s record in one tuple, sample is given below.

Each Tuple (Feature vector) must contain all subjects of the first two semesters, CGPA ,
Warning and pick the data structure as a label or target class. Do not consider or select those
students who did not have studied the data structures. There are around 312 students available in
this dataset who have studied the data structures with their 1st and 2nd semesters record. So after
prepossessing you will get a dataset with around 312 instances. The data shown in this sample
might be changed from data given to you, however, you got the idea of how to prepare the
training examples for data training. Yes, each tuple/ feature vector will be used as a training
example in the training of the trees and you are required to create around 312 tuples (Training
examples/instances).


Now split the dataset examples into two with name training_dataset and testing_dataset. Assign
the first 250 examples as training_dataset and 62 examples as testing_dataset.

## 2.Feature selection
You are required to build different trees, each of them built over a specific extraction of the
observations from the dataset and a specific extraction of the features. Not every tree sees all the
features or all the observations, and this guarantees that the trees are de-correlated and therefore
less prone to over-fitting. Each tree is also a sequence of grade predictions based on a single or
combination of features. At each node you are required to choose the feature that best split the
dataset, the split divides the dataset into 2 buckets, each of them hosting observations that are
more similar among themselves and different from the ones in the other bucket. Therefore, the
importance of each feature is derived from how “pure” each of the buckets is, Node purity is a
measure of how homogeneous a node is. An example of node purity is information entropy.
Beginning with the question Which attribute should be tested at the root of the tree? Each
instance attribute is evaluated using a statistical test (Information Gain and entropy) to determine
how well it alone classifies the training examples. The “best attribute” is selected and used as the
root node of the tree by calculating the information gain and entropy.
How to calculate information gain and entropy?

### 2.1. Instructions for Feature selection
Every training example contains around 16 features (subject grades, waring and cgpa) with 1
Label class (Data structure).
Step 1: Get the Windows Size in Int type variable
Step 2: Select the first 5 features out of 16 features, assume that the value of Windows_Size is 5,
if the Windows_Size is 3 then you are required to select the first 3 features.
Step 3: Calculate the entropy and Gain of each feature subset which is selected in the step 2.
Step 4: Choose attribute with the largest information gain as the root node, divide the dataset to
its branches by grades value (each node must have the 16 Childs (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C,
C-, D+ , D, F)).
Step 5: Grow the tree and repeat the same process of feature selection on every node but on each
node shift the window by round robin fashion (a fixed time slot is assigned in a cyclic way) on
features by 2 and do not select the already selected feature.
Example: Features (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, s9, s10, s11, s12, s13, s14, cgpa, warning) If the
Windows_Size =5 then subset= {s1,s2,s3,s4,s5} and root node must be from these 5 features
according to the value of the Gain.


For the next node, shift the windows by 2, then subset= {s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8} and the next node
must be from these 5 features according to the value of the Gain. Remember previously selected
features cannot be placed on the same branch of the tree.
Step 6a: A branch with the entropy of 0 is a leaf node.
Step 6b: A branch with entropy more than 0 needs further splitting.
Step 7: This function runs recursively on the non-leaf branches until all data is classified.

## 3. Training Model (Generate the forest of trees)
Here, you are going to generate multiple decision trees, every tree must predict the grade of data
structures, collect the predictions from every decision tree and return mode (majority voting) of
the predictions that will be your final grade of data structure, if the two or more classes have the
same mode, then all the classes with same mode will be your possible grades. Prior to the tree
generation, you have must have the following parameters Windows_Size and No_of_trees in
order to generate the trees.

### 3.1. Instructions to generate the trees
Repeat the same process of feature selection on every Tree but each tree must be distinct from
the previously generated tree, each time after generating 1 tree shift the Window by 2 in round
robin fashion and don’t select the root node that is already selected.
Example: Feature (s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8,s9,s10) If the Windows_Size =5 and No_of_trees=5,
then
 subset1 for root-selection of tree1 = {s1,s2,s3,s4,s5} and root node must be from these 5
features according to the value of the Gain.
 Subset2 for root-selection of tree2= {s3,s4,s5,s6,s7} and root node must be from these 5
features according to the value of the Gain.
 Subset3 for root-selection of tree3= {s5,s6,s7,s8,s9} and root node must be from these 5
features according to the value of the Gain.
 Subset4 for root-selection of tree4= {s2,s3,s4,s5,s6} and root node must be from these 5
features according to the value of the Gain.
 Subset5 for root-selection of tree5= {s8,s9,s10,s1,s2} and root node must be from these 5
features according to the value of the Gain.
Note: collect the predictions from every decision tree and the mode (majority voting) of the
predictions will be your final grade of data structure. After completing these steps your training
model is ready for testing.


## 4. Testing (Prediction Phase)

Never evaluate performance on training data. The conclusion would be optimistically biased.
therefore, used the testing_dataset on testing instances. Write a function that expect the test
instance and return the predicted class label after parsing it from all the tress. After parsing all
the 62 testing instances from all the tress, now you have 62 predicted results, compare those
results with real values available in the testing examples with the name of CS201(Data
structures) and calculate the prediction accuracy, Formula=link. Here is the is entire model for
your better understanding.

## 5. Traversals to display the trees

At this point you have successfully trained and test the model. Now all you have to do is push a
test instance in your trained model which creates the trees depending upon the parameters (
Windows_Size and No_of_trees) and display the all trees for single instance using three different
travels(Inorder , Preorder, Postorder).
### 5.1. Inorder traversal
 First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree
 Then the root node
 Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
### 5.2. Preorder traversal
 Visit root node
 Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
 Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
### .3. Postorder traversal
 Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
 Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
 Visit the root node

## 6. Display the predictions of trees with mode

Push a test instance in your trained model which creates the trees depending upon the parameters
(Windows_Size and No_of_trees) and display prediction of each tree with mode (Majority
voting) if the two or more classes have the same mode, then all the classes with same mode will
be your possible grades.
